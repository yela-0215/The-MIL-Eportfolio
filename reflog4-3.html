    <h1>Pain Points</h1>
    <p>The primary obstacle to my efficient learning during the lesson was the preoccupation of my mind with the upcoming tests I needed to make up for, especially since they were scheduled after the discussion of the lesson. This preoccupation significantly hindered my ability to fully engage with the material and absorb the concepts being presented. Instead of being fully present and attentive during the lesson, my thoughts were divided, focusing on the impending tests and the need to prepare for them.</p>

    <p>As a result, I found it challenging to concentrate on the lesson content and may have missed important details or concepts. In hindsight, I realize the importance of managing my time and priorities effectively to ensure that I can fully devote my attention to learning without the distraction of looming tests.</p>
