    <h1>Pain Points</h1>
    <p>Being ill and absent during the live discussions definitely presented a challenge in fully absorbing the lessons. Missing out on the interactive aspect of the learning experience meant that I didn't have the opportunity to engage with the material as actively as I would have liked. The absence of real-time discussion and exchange of ideas may have hindered my ability to grasp certain concepts thoroughly. Additionally, feeling mentally unprepared could have further impeded my learning process. When our minds are preoccupied or not in the right state to receive and process information, it can be difficult to fully comprehend and retain new knowledge.</p>

    <p>The mental barrier may have prevented me from fully immersing myself in the lesson, causing the information to feel like it's passing through without making a lasting impact. In situations like these, it's important to acknowledge the challenges and explore alternative methods of learning and comprehension. This could involve reviewing the material at a slower pace, seeking clarification from the instructor or peers, or engaging in independent study to reinforce the concepts. By recognizing the obstacles to learning and actively seeking solutions, I can overcome these barriers and ensure a more effective and meaningful learning experience in the future.</p>
