    <h1>My Key Takeaways</h1>
    <p>McLuhan's theory of technological determinism is intriguing, suggesting that changes in technology drive big changes in society. It makes sense when you think about how things like smartphones and social media have transformed how we live and communicate. But I'm not entirely sold on the idea that technology is the only thing calling the shots. It seems like people also play a big role in shaping technology, with our choices and needs influencing what gets developed and how it's used.
</p>

    <p>As for the relationship between media and individuals, I think it's more of a give-and-take. Sure, media can shape our views and behaviors, but we also have the power to choose how we interact with it. Being smart about what we consume and questioning what we see and hear is important. And media creators need to think about how their work affects different people and make sure it's fair and inclusive. Overall, it's a complex relationship that involves both technology and human agency.
